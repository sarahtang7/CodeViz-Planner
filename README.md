A tool to help developers visually plan codebase structures

## Overview
The goals of this web application are to

1. allow developers to visually plan out a codebase workflow in diagram-form, and
2. produce a subsequent skeleton directory

I find the process of planning the structure and flow of a codebase to be tricky -- this tool aims to enhance that process with a more visual and manipulable interface.
